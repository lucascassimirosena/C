Objective

In this challenge, you will learn simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a bunch of statements grouped together. A function is provided with zero or more arguments, and it executes the statements on it. Based on the return type, it either returns nothing (void) or something.

A sample syntax for a function is:

	return_type function_name(arg_type_1 arg_1, arg_type_2 arg_2, ...) {
    	...
        ...
        ...
        [if return_type is non void]
        	return something of type `return_type`;
    }

For example, a function to read four variables and return the sum of them can be written as:

	int sum_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    	int sum = 0;
        sum += a;
        sum += b;
        sum += c;
        sum += d;
        return sum;
    }

+= : Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

a += b is equivalent to a = a + b;

Task

Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.
*/

int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)
{
    int a, b, c, d;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d);
    
    
}
