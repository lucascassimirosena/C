/* Command Line Arguments 

Sometimes when I program is created that recquires the developer to enter a small amount of information
at the terminal.

This information must consist of a number indicating the triangular number that you want to have 
calculated or a word that you want to have looked up in a dictionary

Two ways of handling this:
    Requesting the data from the user
    Supply the information to the program at the time the program is executed (command-line arguments)

We know that the main() function is a special function in C
    Entry point of the program

When main() is called by the runtime system, two arguments are actually passed to the function
    The first argument (argc for the argument count) is an interger value that specifies the number of
    arguments typed on the command line.
    The second argument (argv for argument vector) is an array of characters pointers (strings)
